The Florida Geographic Data Library is a collection of Geospatial Data
compiled by the University of Florida GeoPlan Center with support from
the Florida Department of Transportation. GIS data available in FGDL is
collected from various state, federal, and other agencies (data sources)
who are data stewards, producers, or publishers. The data available in
FGDL may not be the most current version of the data offered by the
data source. University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no guarantees
about the currentness of the data and suggests that data users check
with the data source to see if more recent versions of the data exist.

Furthermore, the GIS data available in the FGDL are provided 'as is'.
The University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no warranties, guaranties

provided by the data sources. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center

A note about data scale: 

Scale is an important factor in data usage.  Certain scale datasets
are not suitable for some project, analysis, or modeling purposes.
Please be sure you are using the best available data. 

1:24000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
county level.
1:24000 data should NOT be used for high accuracy base mapping such
as property parcel boundaries.
1:100000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
multi-county or regional level.
1:125000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
regional or state level or larger.

Vector datasets with no defined scale or accuracy should be
considered suspect. Make sure you are familiar with your data
before using it for projects or analysis. Every effort has been
made to supply the user with data documentation. For additional
information, see the References section and the Data Source Contact
section of this documentation. For more information regarding
scale and accuracy, see our webpage at:

<strong><b>DATA LINEAGE SUMMARY: </b></strong>
<br />
<table width="60%">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
In 2012 the FCC stopped releasing tower and antenna locations as spatial 
data. Data layers are available as databases with associated .dat files. 

GeoPlan downloaded the Cellular 47 CFR Part 22 from 
http://wireless.fcc.gov/antenna/index.htm?job=uls_transaction&amp;page=weekly in 
August 2019. During the QA/QC process GeoPlan performed the following steps:

- Opened and formatted the LO.dat file in Excel. File was saved as a CVS and then 
  exported to .dbf in ArcMap.  Added field names using previous fgdl versions of cellur.
  Saved coordinate fields as LATD, LATM, LATS, LAT_DIR, LOND, LONM, 
  LONS, and LON_DIR
- Filtered .dbf to contain only records located in Florida. (Using field Location State
  Code from LO.dat
- Added LAT and LONG fields using type = double
- Used field calculator to convert coordinate fields from DMS to DD. The 
  equation for latitude was:
	( [LATS] /3600) + ( [LATM] /60) + [LATD]
  The equation for longitude was:
	( [LONS] /3600) + ( [LONM] /60) + [LOND]
- Generated XY data using the LATDD and LONDD fields.  The projection
  was defined as WGS 1984.
- Exported XY events to shapefile.
- Fields  LATD, LATM, LATS, LAT_DIR, LOND, LONM, LONS, and LON_DIR
  were deleted.
- Removed one feature that was incorrectly attributed to Florida. LIC_ID = 12969, 
  LICENSEE = USCOC OF GREATER OKLAHOMA, LLC
- Projected the new shapefile to NAD83 HARN using the
  WGS_1984_(ITRF00)_To_NAD_1983 + NAD_1983_To_HARN_Florida transformation

- Opened and formatted EN.dat file in Excel and exported to .dbf in ArcMap. Added field
  names using previous fgdl versions of cellur. Fields not present in previous versions were 
  removed.
- EN.dbf file brought into ArcMap and joined with the LO file info using LIC_ID field. 
- Edited the feature class attribute table to match previous versions
- Added field MGRS by using the Convert Coordinate Notation tool and choosing
  output coordinate format as MGRS.
- Added field GOOGLEMAP by concatenating:
  https://www.google.com/maps/place/ and the MGRS ID
- Added descript field based on CALLSIGN.
- Added FGDLAQDATE based on the date GeoPlan acquired the data
- Restructured table and uppercased all fields

Field Changes

- Previous fields LAT_DMS and LON_DMS have been renamed to LAT and LON.
- Removed fields LATDIR and LONDIR

Notes:
When the FCC generated this data set spatially in the past they only included 
lat/lon in DMS. Previously the seconds included no decimal places and now 
they do include 1 decimal place. Now that we are generating the spatial locations 
from this data the improved accuracy has resulted is a visible shift that varies 
anywhere from 1-36 meters.
